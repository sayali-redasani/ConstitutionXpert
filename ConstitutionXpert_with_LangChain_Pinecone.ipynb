       "Document(page_content='CONSTITUTION OF INDIA:\\n\\nThe Constitution of India is the supreme law of India. The document lays down the framework that demarcates fundamental political code, structure, procedures, powers, and duties of government institutions and sets out fundamental rights, directive principles, and the duties of citizens. It is the longest written national constitution in the world.\\n\\nThe Constitution of India imparts constitutional supremacy (not parliamentary supremacy, since it was created by a constituent assembly rather than Parliament) and was adopted by its people with a declaration in its preamble.Parliament cannot override the constitution.\\n\\nThe Constitution was adopted by the Constituent Assembly of India on 26 November 1949 and became effective on 26 January 1950. The constitution replaced the Government of India Act 1935 as the country\\'s fundamental governing document, and the Dominion of India became the Republic of India. To ensure constitutional autochthony, its framers repealed prior acts of the British parliament in Article 395. India celebrates its constitution on 26 January as Republic Day.\\n\\nThe constitution declares India a sovereign, socialist, secular, and democratic republic, assures its citizens justice, equality, and liberty, and endeavours to promote fraternity. The original 1950 constitution is preserved in a nitrogen-filled case at the Parliament House in New Delhi.\\n\\nThe Constitution of India or the Constitution of the Republic of India came in effect on January 26, 1950 and is the longest written constitution of any independent nation in the world. It contains 22 Parts 395 articles and 12 schedules. It has a total of 117,369 words in its English language version.\\n\\nHistory of the Constitution of India: At the end of World War II in Europe on May 9, 1945, a new government came to power in the United Kingdom. This government announced to convene a constituent drafting body in India. A team of ministers, called the Cabinet Mission, were sent to India to find solution to the question of India\\'s independence. The Cabinet Mission discussed the framework and the procedure to be followed the drafting body. With India\\'s independence, the Constituent Assembly became a fully sovereign body and they began the working from 9 December 1947. The Assembly had members belonging to different communities, regions and even from different political persuasions of India. Dr. Rajendra Prasad was the elected president and B.R. Ambedkar, the chairman of the Drafting Committee. Over a period of 2 years, 11 months and 18 days, before submitting the final copy of the Constitution, the Constituent Assembly met for 166 days and the sessions were always open to the press and the public.\\n\\nFeatures of the Constitution of India: It has been extensively drawn from Western legal traditions in enunciation of the principles of liberal democracy. The principles of the Constitution reflect aspirants to end the inequities of traditional social relations and to enhance the social welfare of the population. Since the enactment, the constitution has always fostered for a steady concentrate of power to the central government, especially to Prime Minister Office (PMO).\\n\\nFeatures of the Indian Constitution: The Indian constitution is unique in its content and spirit. The salient features ofthe constitution are as follows: Lengthiest written Constitution Blend of Rigidity and Flexibility Federal system with unitary features Parliamentary form of Government Independent judiciary Single citizenship Emergency provision\\n\\nStructure of the Indian Constitution: The Indian Constitution originally consisted of 395 Art, 22 parts, 8 Schedules. But after the Constitution 104th Amendment Act, 2003, the Indian Constitution Consists of 448 Art, 25 parts, 12 Schedules.\\n\\nPreamble: The preamble to the constitution is based on the “ objective resolution” drafted and moved by Pandit Nehru and adopted by constituent assembly. The Preamble highlights few fundamental values and guiding principles on which the Constitution of India is based. It serves as the guiding light for both, the Constitution as well as the judges who interpret the Constitution in its light. The opening few words of the Preamble - \"We, the people\" - signifies that the power is vested in the hands of the people of India. The Preamble is as follows: “We THE PEOPLE OF INDIA, having solemnly resolved to constitute India in to a SOVERIGN SOCIALIST SECULAR DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC and to secure to all its citizen: JUSTICE, social, Economic, and Political; LIBERTY of thought, expression, belief, faith and worship; EQUALITY of status and of opportunity;and to promote among them all, FRATERNITY assuring the dignity of the individual and the unity and integrity of the nation; In our Constituent Assembly, this 26th November, 1949, do hereby adopt, enact and give to ourselves this constitution.”\\n\\nInitially the preamble was not the part of the Constitution of India but the Supreme Court, in the case of \\'Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala\\' found it to be part of the Constitution and can be used in interpret ambiguous areas of the Constitution. The words \"SOCIALIST\" and \"SECULAR\" were introduced in 42nd amendment act 1976.\\n\\nPurpose of the Preamble: The preamble to the constitution is a key to open the minds of the makers and shows the general purpose for which they made the several provisions in the constitution. Preamble serves the following purposes: 1. It discloses the source of the constitution. 2. It lays down the date of the commencement of the constitution. 3. It set out the rights and freedoms which the people of India wished to secure for themselves. 4. It declares the nature of the government.\\n\\nTerms of Preamble: Sovereign: \"Sovereign\" means supreme or independent. The country is both, internally as well as externally sovereign. Externally it is free from any foreign power and internally it exercises a free government directly elected by the people and makes laws that govern the people.\\n\\nSocialist: The word was added by the 42nd amendment act of 1976. It implies to social and economic equality. Social equality means there is no discrimination on the grounds of caste, color, creed, sex, religion, language, etc. Each one enjoys equal status and opportunities. By economic equality it means that the government will endeavour for equal distribution of wealth and to provide a decent standard of living for all, hence a committment in forming a welfare state. Abolition of Untouchability and Zamindari, the Equal Wages Act and the Child Labour Prohibition Act were few steps taken by the government in this context.\\n\\nSecular: The word \"Secular\" was inserted by the 42nd amendment act of 1976. Secular implies equality of all religions and religious tolerance. No state in India have an official state religion. Anybody can preach, practice and propagate any religion of his or her choice. In the eyes of law all citizens are equal irrespective of their religious beliefs. No religious instruction is imparted in government schools or government-aided schools.\\n\\nDemocratic: \"Democratic\" means that the government of all levels are elected by the people through a system of universal adult franchise. Every citizen irrespective of caste, creed, color, sex, religion or education who is 18 years of age and above is entitled to vote, if not debarred by law.\\n\\nRepublic - The term \"Republic\" means that the head of the state is elected, directly or indirectly, for a fixed tenure. The President of India is elected by Electoral College for a fixed period of five years.\\n\\nNature of Indian Constitution: The Constitution is of two kinds: 1. Unitary: In a Unitary Constitutions the powers of the Government are centralized in one Government v.z. the States or Provinces are Subordinates to the Centre. 2. Federal: In Federal Constitution, there is a division of Powers between the federal and the State Government and both are independent in their own spheres. The American Constitution is universally regarded as an example of the Federal Constitution.\\n\\nCharacteristics of a federal Constitution: 1. A Written Constitution: For a federal Constitution it is Mandatory that there should be a written Constitution. 2. Dual Government: In case of federal constitution, there is system of dual government one at centre and another at state. 3. Supremacy of Constitutions: For a federal Constitution there should be supremacy of the Constitution. At the time of the exercise of power by three organs of the Govt. i.e. legislative, executive and Judiciary, all functions are Subordinated and Controlled by the Constitution. 4. Distribution of Powers: Federalism means the distribution of powers of the State among a Number of Co-ordinate bodies each originating in and controlled by the Constitution 5. Rigidity:- Rigidity is one of the Basic essential of a federal Constitution. It highly depends on the Process of amendment. 6. Independent Judiciary: There should be an independent judiciary having authority on other organs. In a federal Constitution the courts (Judiciary) has the final power to interpret the  Constitution. Thus it can be concluded that the Judiciary is the \"Guardian of the Constitution\". Conclusion: Finally it can be said that the Indian Constitution is neither Purely federal nor purely unitary but a Unique Combination of Both aspects.\\n\\nPeculiar feature of Indian Constitution: Mode of formation Position of the state Citizenship Residuary power The lengthiest Constitution in the world.\\n\\nMeaning of State: According to Article 12 the State includes:- The Government and parliament of India The Government and legislature of each of the states. All local and other authorities: Within the territory of India and under the control of the Government of India All the fundamental rights are available against the state with a few exception.\\n\\nFundamental Rights in the Constitution: The aim of Fundamental Rights is that certain elementary rights such as right to life, liberty, freedom of speech and freedom of faith and so on should be regarded as inviolable under all circumstances and that the shifting majority in legislatures of the country should not have a free hand in interfering with fundamental rights. Fundamental right is called the Magna Carta of India.\\n\\nRights to Equality: a. Equality before law-Article 14. b. Prohibition of discrimination on the grounds of religion race, caste, sex or place of Birth Article 15. c. Equality of opportunity in matters of public employment, Article 16. d. Abolition of untouchability Article 17 e. Abolition of titles, Article 18.\\n\\nEquality before Law: Article 14 – says that “the State shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of India.”  It uses two expressions: (1) “Equality before the law; and (2) Equal Protection of the laws\\n\\nEquality before law: This concept is taken from British Constitution. The concept of equality does not mean absolute equality among human beings which is physically no possible to achieve. It is a concept implying absence of any special privilege by reason of birth, Creed or the like in favour of any individual, and also the equal subject of all individuals and classes to the ordinary law of the land. In the words of Dr.Jennings- “Equality before the law” means that among equals the law should be equal and should be equally administered, that like should be treated alike.\\n\\nRule of law: The guarantee of „equality before the law‟ is an aspect of what Dicey Calls the “rule of law” in England. It means that no man is above the law and that every person, whatever be his rank or conditions, is subject to the jurisdiction of ordinary courts. \"Dicey the Rule of Law has three distinct meaning\"  (1) Supremacy of the law (2) Equality before the flaw (3) The Constitution is the result of the ordinary law of the land.\\n\\nEqual Protection of the Laws: This concept is taken from American constitution. This has been interpreted to mean subjection to equal law, applying to all in the same circumstances. It only means that all persons similarly circumstance shall be treated alike both in the privileges conferred and liabilities imposed by the law equal law should be applied to all in the same situation and there should be no discrimination between one person and another. The words “any person” in Article 14 of the constitution denotes that the guarantee of the equal protection of laws is available to any person which includes any company or association or body of individuals. The protection of Article 14 extends to both citizens and non-citizens and to natural persons as well as legal persons. The equality before the law is guaranteed to all without regard to race, colour or nationality. Corporations being juristic persons are also entitled to the benefit of Article 14.\\n\\nTest of Reasonable classification: While Article 14 forbids class legislation; it permits reasonable classification of persons, objects and transactions by the legislature for the purpose of achieving specific ends. But classification must not be arbitrary, artificial or evasive”. It must always rest upon some real and substantial distinction bearing a just and reasonable relation to the object sought to be achieved by the legislature, classification to be reasonable must fulfill the following two conditions – 1. the classification must be founded on an “intelligible differentia” which distinguishes persons or things that are grouped together from others left out of the group. 2. the differentia must have a rational relation to the object sought to be achieved by the Act. K.Thimmappa v. Chairman Central Board of Directors SBI and Ram Krishna Dalmia vs. J. Tandulkar\\n\\nNew Concept of Equality: Protection against arbitrariness: In E.P.Royappa v. State of Tamil Nadu the new concept of equality in the following words – “Equality is a dynamic concept with many aspects and dimensions and it cannot be described, Cabined and confined” within traditional limits from a positivistic point of view, equality is antithesis to arbitrariness. In fact equality and arbitrariness are sworn enemies, one belong to the rule of law in a republic while the other, to the whim and caprice of an absolute monarch. Where an act is arbitrary, it is implicit in it that it is unequal both according to political logic and constitutional law and is therefore violative of Article 14.\\n\\nExceptions to the equality before law- Article 361 of the Constitution permits the following exceptions to this rule – The President or the Governor of a State shall not be answerable to any court. No criminal proceeding whatsoever shall be instituted or continued against the President or a Governor in any court during his term of office. No Civil Proceeding in which relief is claimed against the President or the Governor of a state shall be instituted during his term of office in any Court in respect of any act done or purporting to be done by him in his personal capacity.\\n\\nProhibition of discrimination on certain grounds: Article 15(1) provides that the state shall not discriminate against any citizen on grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex, place of birth or any of them\\n\\nArticle 15 (2) provides that: No citizen shall be on above grounds, subject to any disability, liability, restriction or condition with regard to— a. access to shops, public restaurants, hotels and places of public entertainment; or b. the use of wells, tanks, bathing ghats, roads and places of public resort maintained wholly or partly out of State funds or dedicated to the use of the general public.\\n\\nExceptions to Article 15: Article 15 (3), (4) and (5) contains exceptions to the general principal laid down under Article 15 (1) and (2): Nothing in this article shall prevent the State from making any special provision for women and children. Nothing in this article shall prevent the State from making any special provision for the advancement of any socially and educationally backward classes of citizens or for the Scheduled Castes.

To own and acquire movable and immovable property; and To administer such property in accordance with law.\\n\\nDenomination:- Religious denomination should satisfy the following condition: It should be body of individuals who have been system of beliefs which they regards as conductive to their spiritual well being. It should have common organisation; and It should be designated by a distinctive name. For example: - ‘Ramakrishna mission’ and ‘Anand Marg’ and Arvindo Society is not the denomination.\\n\\nFreedom from taxation for promotion of Religion: Article 27 lays down that no person shall be compelled to pay any taxes for the promotion or maintenance of any particular religion or religious denomination. In other words, the state should not spend the public money collected by way of tax for the promotion or maintenance of any particular religion. This provision prohibits only levy of tax and not a fees. This is because the purpose of fee is to control secular administration of religious institutions not to promote or maintain religion.\\n\\nFreedom from attending religious instruction (RI): Article 28 provides that no religious instruction shall be provided in any educational institution wholly maintained out of state funds. However, this provision shall not apply to an educational institution administered by the state but established under any endowment or trust requiring imparting of religious institution in such institution.\\n\\nArticle 28 distinguishes between four types of educational institutions: Article 28 distinguishes between four types of educational institutions:- Institutions wholly maintained by the state- religious instruction (RI) totally prohibited Institutions administered by the state but established under any endowment or trust-RI permitted Institutions recognised by the state- RI is permitted on voluntary basis Institutions receiving aid from the state- RI is permitted on voluntary basis.\\n\\nCultural and Educational Rights: Protection of interest of minority:  Article 29 Any section of the citizens residing in the territory of India or any part thereof having a distinct language, script or culture of its own shall have the right to conserve the same.

The State shall not, in granting aid to educational institutions, discriminate against any educational institution on the ground that it is under the management of a minority, whether based on religion or language.\\n\\nMinority educational institutions are of three types:- 1. Institutions that seek recognition as well as aid from the state. 2. Institutions that seek only recognition from the state not aid. 3. Institutions that neither seek recognition nor aid from the state. Only first two types of institutions are subject to state control.\\n\\nRight to constitutional Remedies: Article 32 A mere declaration of fundamental rights in the constitution is meaningless, useless and worthless without providing effective machinery for their enforcement. In other words right of enforcement is itself a fundamental right. That is why Dr. Ambedkar called Article 32 as the heart and soul of the constitution.\\n\\nArticle 32 empowers the Supreme Court to act as defender and guarantor of the fundamental rights of the citizen. It has been vested with ‘original and ‘wide’ powers for that purpose. The purpose of Art. 32 is to provide a guaranteed, effective, expeditious, inexpensive and summary remedy for the protection of the fundamental rights. Only the fundamental right can be enforced and not any other right like statutory right, customary rights etc. The violation of fundamental right is sine qua non for the applicability of article 32. However, the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court in case of violation fundamental right is concurrent with the jurisdiction of the High Court as per Article 226 of the constitution. It means when the fundamental right of a citizen is violated, the aggrieved party has the option of moving either the High Court or Supreme Court directly. Supreme Court and High Court ( in case of any other right also) provides the remedy in form of writ.\\n\\nWrits in the Constitution: Following are different writs in the constitution Habeas Corpus: It is Latin term which literally means ‘to have the body of’. It is an order issued by the court to a person who has detained another person to produce the body of latter before it. The court then examines the cause and legality of the detention. It would set the detained person free, if the detention is found to be illegal. Thus writ is a bulwark of individual liberty against arbitrary detention. The writ of Habeas Corpus can issued against both public and private person. However it cannot be issued in following cases:- 1. Detention is lawful. 2. Proceeding is for contempt of legislation or a court. 3. Detention is by a competent court. 4. Detention is outside the jurisdiction of the court.\\n\\nMandamus: It literally means ‘we command’. It is command issued by the court to a public official asking him to perform his official duties that he has failed or refused to perform. It can also be issued against any public body, a corporation, an inferior court, a tribunal or government for the same purpose. It cannot be issued in the following cases: 1. Against a private individual or body 2. To enforce departmental instruction 3. When the duty is discretionary not mandatory 4. Against the president or Governor.\\n\\nProhibition:- Literally means ‘to forbid’. It is issued by higher court to a lower court or tribunal to prevent the latter from exceeding the jurisdiction. Thus unlike, mandamus that directs activity, the prohibition directs inactivity. It is not issued against Administrative authorities, Legislative authorities and Private individuals.\\n\\nCertiorari:- In the literal sense, it means ‘to be certified’ or ‘to be informed’. It is issued by higher court to a lower court or tribunal either to transfer a case pending with the latter to itself or squash the order of the latter in a case. It is issued on the grounds of Excess of jurisdiction, Lack of jurisdiction and Error of law. Thus, unlike prohibition, which is only preventive, certiorari is both preventive as well as curative. Certiorari can be issued against even the administrative authorities affecting the rights of individual as per the ruling of the supreme since 1991.\\n\\nQuo-Warranto:- In the literal sense, ‘it means by what authority or warrant’. It is issued by the court to enquire in to the legality of claim of a person to a public office.\\n\\nDirective Principles of State Policy (DPSP) in the Constitution: The Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSP) contained in Part IV of the Constitution set out aims and objective to be taken up by the States in the governance of the country.

Fundamental Rights are contained in Part III of the Constitution. These are defined in Art 12 to 35. These rights are provided for to every person of India and it can be enforced by the Court.\\n\\nIn Kesvanand Bharti v.

Answer: In the case of Kesvanand Bharti vs. State of Kerala, the supreme has held that preamble is part of the constitution. Preamble is of extreme importance and the constitution should be read and interpreted in the light of grand and noble vision expressed in the preamble. However, two things should be noted: The preamble is neither a source of power to legislature nor prohibition upon the powers of legislature. It is not justiciable i.e. not enforceable in courts of law.\\n\\nQuestion: Whether preamble can be amended? Answer: Supreme Court has held that preamble can be amended subject to the condition that no amendment is done to the ‘ Basic structure’ of the constitution. The Preamble has been amended only once by the 42nd Constitutional Amendment act, which has added three new words- Socialistic, Secular and Integrity- to the preamble.\\n\\nQuestion: Corporation when deemed to be state? Answer: According to the judgment of Ajay hasia vs. Khalid Mujib If the entire share capital is held by government. Financial assistance is provided by the government to meet the entire expenditure. When corporation enjoys a monopoly status. When the state is having deep and pervasive control over the affairs of the corporation. If the corporation is discharging public function. Corporation acting as an agency instrumentality of the government. ( RD Shetty vs. IAA). Stock Exchange is not a state because it is independent from the government control. (Satish nayak vs. Cochin Stock Exchange Ltd.)\\n\\nIn Prabhu Datt Vs. Union of India – Supreme Court held that right to know news and information about the functioning of the Govt., is included in the freedom of Press.\\n\\nIn Union of India Vs. Association for Democratic Reforms– Supreme Court held that people have right to know about the candidate before voting. Thus, the law preventing the Election Commission from asking for a candidate’s wealth, Assets, liabilities education and other such information is invalid.\\n\\nIn Tata Press Ltd. Vs. M.T.N.L. the Supreme Court held that commercial speech (Advertisement) is a part of freedom of speech and expression U/A 19(1) (a).\\n\\nIn Union of India V. Naveen Jindal, The Court held that “Flying National Flag” is fundamental Right U/A 19(1) (a)\\n\\nFreedom of Silence – Right not to speak, In Bijoy emmanual Vs. State of Kerala.\\n\\nFreedom of the Press - the freedom of press defined in the Indian Constitution U/A 19(1) (a) In Indian Express newspaper Vs. Union of India, the Court observed the expression “Freedom of the Press” has not been used in Article 19.\\n\\nPre-censorship Invalid – In Ramesh Thapper Vs. State of Madras.\\n\\nIn Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India. The Court has given the widest possible interpretation of Personal liberty. Thus Article 21 requires the following Conditions to be fulfilled before a Person is deprived of Personal liberty. There must me a valid law. The law must provide a Procedure. The Procedure must be (just, fair and Reasonable) ensuring Natural Justice.\\n\\nRight to life includes within its ambit the right to live with Human dignity. The S.C. held that the right to life defines not only physical existence but the “quality of life.”\\n\\nJudicial Pronouncement on right to Life & personal liberty: Right to Travel abroad. (Satwant Singh v. Assistant Passport officer) Right to livelihood. (D.K.Yadav v. J.M.A Industries) Right to Shelter. (Chameli Singh v. State of U.P.) Right to Privacy. (R.Raja Gopal v. State of T.N.) In PUCL Vs. Union of India, the S.C. held that telephone tapping is a serious invasion of an individual’s right to Privacy which is part of the right to life and personal liberty. Right to Health & Medical Assistance. Right to die NOT A RIGHT TO LIFE Protection of Ecology and Environmental Pollution Right to education under Article 21A Prisoner’s Right. The Court held that if the Prisoner died due to beating by Police Officer, his family is entitled to compensation. Right to free Legal Aid Right to speedy Trial Right Against Handcuffing Right against Delayed Execution. Right to food Right to Marriage. (Lata Singh v. State of U.P.) Right to Reputation. Right to Die. In case of Gian Kaur v. State of Punjab “The Constitutional Bench of Supreme Court held that “right to life” Under Article 21 does not include “right to die.”\\n\\nArticle 22 has two parts:- First part deals with the ordinary law Second part deals with the preventive detention\\n\\nFirst part of Article 22: It deals with the detention under the ordinary law and provides for the following: Right to be informed of the grounds of arrest. Right to consult and be defended by a legal practitioner. Right to be produced before magistrate within 24 hours, excluding the journey time. Right to be released after 24 hours unless the Magistrate authorises further detention. These safeguards are not available to an alien or a person arrested or detained under preventive detention. Supreme Court has held that first part is not applicable in case of civil arrest, failure to pay income tax.\\n\\nSecond Part of Article 22: It deals with the detention under the preventive detention law. The protection is available to both citizen as well as alien and includes the following: The detention of person cannot exceed three months unless an advisory board reports sufficient cause for extended detention. The grounds of detention should be communicated to the detenue. The detenue should be afforded an opportunity to make representation against the detention order.\\n\\nTRADE, COMMERCE AND INTERCOURSE: Meaning:- The word “trade” means “buying” or “selling” of goods while the term “Commerce” includes all forms of transportation such as by land, air or water. The term “intercourse” means movement of goods from one place to another place. The words trade commerce and intercourse covers all kinds of activities which are likely to come under the nature of commerce. It is to be noted that Article 19 (1) (g) also guarantees to citizens the right to practice any profession or carry on any trade, business, etc. But while Article 19 (1) (g) confers a fundamental right on citizens to carry on trade, business etc. Article 301 confers only a statutory right. The right under Article 19 (1) (g) can only be claimed by citizens, but the right under Article 301 can be claimed by any one.\\n\\nThe word “free” in Article 301 – does not mean freedom from Laws or regulations. There is a clear distinction between laws interfering with freedom to carry out the activities constituting trade and law imposing rules of proper conduct or other restraints for the due and orderly manner of carrying out the activities. The distinction is known as regulations.\\n\\nThe word “regulation” has no fixed connotation. Its meaning differs according to the nature of the thing which it is applied. A purely regulatory and compensatory law cannot be regarded as violative of the freedom of trade and commerce. Such laws are intended merely to regulate trade and commerce they tend, to facilitate, and not restrict or restrain freedom or trade. Thus, such measures as traffic regulations, licensing of vehicles, charging for the maintenance of roads, marketing and health regulations, price control, economic and social planning prescribing minimum wages are purely regulatory measures., than a law which levies a tax or toll for the use of a road or bridge is not a barrier or burden on a trade but in reality helps the free-flow of trade by enabling the provision of a mare convenient and less expensive route. Such compensatory taxes are no hindrance to any such freedom of trade so long as they are within reasonable limits, if the amount of such taxes are unduly high it certainly would hamper trade.\\n\\nIn this connection the Court has pointed out that the distinction between “freedom” in Article 301 and “restriction” in Article 302 and 304 must be kept in mind, and that which, in reality facilitates trade cannot be a restriction. While that which actually hampers trade will be a restriction.\\n\\n“The Majority judgement in the Atiabari Tea Co’s Case read with a majority judgement in the Automobile’s case lead to the following principles relating of Article 301 1. Article 301 assures freedom of inter-State as well as intra-State trade, Commerce and intercourse. 2. Trade, Commerce and intercourse have the widest connotation and take in movement of goods and persons. 3. The freedom is not only from laws enacted in the exercise of the powers conferred by the legislative entries relating to trade and commerce or production, supply and distribution of goods, but also to all laws including tax laws. only those laws whose direct and immediate effect to inhibit or restrict freedom of trade or commerce will come with the mischief of Article 301. Laws which are merely regulatory or which impose purely compensatory taxes, and hence intended to facilitate freedom of trade, are outside the scope Article 301. 4. Restrictions on Trade and Commerce – Article 301 is subject to the restrictions imposed under Article 302 to 305.\\n\\nParliament’s Power to regulate trade and commerce in the Public interest – Article 302 authorizes Parliament to impose such restrictions on the freedom of trade, commerce or inter course between one State and another or within any part of the territory of India as may be required in the public interest. State‟s power to regulate trade and commerce – Article 304 (a) empowers the State to impose any tax on goods imported from other State if similar goods in the State are subject to similar tax so as not to discriminate between goods so imported and goods manufactured or produced in the State. Saving of existing laws – Article 305 saves existing laws and laws providing for State monopolies in so far as the President may by order otherwise direct. In Saghir Ahmad v. State of U.P. The Supreme Court raised the question whether an Act providing for State monopoly in a particular trade or business conflicts with the freedom of trade and commerce, guaranteed by Article 301, but left the question undecided. Article 19 was amended by the Constitution (first Amendment) Act in order to take out such State monopolies out of the purview of Article 19 (1)(g). But no corresponding provision was added to Article 305. It appears from the judgement of the Supreme Court that in spite of such an amendment a law introducing such State monopoly might have to be justified before the courts as being “in the public interest” or as amounting to a “reasonable” under Article 306 (b) of the Constitution.\\n\\nBorrowed Features of Indian Constitution from other Constitutions: Bag of Borrowings: This term is used to signify the Indian Constitution as a conglomeration of various provisions taken from different constitutions in the world.

The document lays down the framework that demarcates fundamental political code, structure, procedures, powers, and duties of government institutions and sets out fundamental rights, directive principles, and the duties of citizens. It is the longest written national constitution in the world.\\n\\nThe Constitution of India imparts constitutional supremacy (not parliamentary supremacy, since it was created by a constituent assembly rather than Parliament) and was adopted by its people with a declaration in its preamble.Parliament cannot override the constitution.\\n\\nThe Constitution was adopted by the Constituent Assembly of India on 26 November 1949 and became effective on 26 January 1950. The constitution replaced the Government of India Act 1935 as the country's fundamental governing document, and the Dominion of India became the Republic of India. To ensure constitutional autochthony, its framers repealed prior acts of the British parliament in Article 395. India celebrates its constitution on 26 January as Republic Day.\\n\\nThe constitution declares India a sovereign, socialist, secular, and democratic republic, assures its citizens justice, equality, and liberty, and endeavours to promote fraternity. The original 1950 constitution is preserved in a nitrogen-filled case at the Parliament House in New Delhi.\\n\\nThe Constitution of India or the Constitution of the Republic of India came in effect on January 26, 1950 and is the longest written constitution of any independent nation in the world.

It contains 22 Parts 395 articles and 12 schedules. It has a total of 117,369 words in its English language version.\\n\\nHistory of the Constitution of India: At the end of World War II in Europe on May 9, 1945, a new government came to power in the United Kingdom. This government announced to convene a constituent drafting body in India. A team of ministers, called the Cabinet Mission, were sent to India to find solution to the question of India's independence. The Cabinet Mission discussed the framework and the procedure to be followed the drafting body. With India's independence, the Constituent Assembly became a fully sovereign body and they began the working from 9 December 1947. The Assembly had members belonging to different communities, regions and even from different political persuasions of India. Dr. Rajendra Prasad was the elected president and B.R. Ambedkar, the chairman of the Drafting Committee. Over a period of 2 years, 11 months and 18 days, before submitting the final copy of the Constitution, the Constituent Assembly met for 166 days and the sessions were always open to the press and the public.\\n\\nFeatures of the Constitution of India: It has been extensively drawn from Western legal traditions in enunciation of the principles of liberal democracy. The principles of the Constitution reflect aspirants to end the inequities of traditional social relations and to enhance the social welfare of the population. Since the enactment, the constitution has always fostered for a steady concentrate of power to the central government, especially to Prime Minister Office (PMO).\", metadata={'source': '/home/dai/Documents/project practice/project trial/file_context_corpus_cleaned_extended_part3.txt'})"
